The first couple miles are exposed along the hillside with a complete 180-degree view of the coastline. If done during the day in the warmer months, make sure to pack plenty of water and wear sunblock. It is a grassy area, so be mindful of ticks and poison oak. The first mile is all incline and switchbacks on dirt with grass to either side. It definitely sets the tone and warms your legs up. After the first mile, you're a good way up the side of the hill and it flattens out mostly. Right around the third mile or so, the trail ditches the coast and makes its way into the hills. It is at this point that the tree cover begins to take over. \r\n\nWe did not venture that deep into the trees... we made it to the Vicente Flat campground which is 6 miles in on the trail, and then decided to go back to the third mile where there was a nice wide open grassy area with a ridiculous view of the coast and outgoing sunset. \r\n\nFrom our campsite, if you continued to follow the Kirk Creek Trail to the campground, it takes you into the canyon covered by trees the whole way, where the Vicente Flat campground branches off to the left.

There is an interpretive trail guide available for Golden Canyon at the information kiosk at the trailhead. \r\n\nThe canyon is true to its name, carved through golden yellow sediments which were deposited at the bottom of Lake Manly over 5 million years ago. The different color bands seen in the walls signify the presence of different minerals. The trail ascends the canyon on a gentle climb for the first mile of the hike.

The first part of the trail is very sandy with an uphill making for a difficult ascent, but once you reach the highest point on the trail of about 5200 ft, do not get your hopes up because you'll be going up and down a lot more with more climbs and descents. \r\n\nIMPORTANT: The trail marker at the junction between Upper and Lower Covington Flat citing the distance to Keys View Rd as 7 mi is incorrect, it is actually about 9.5 miles to Keys View Rd. The most difficult descent of the trail lies between 10.5 and 12.5 miles where there is steep descending and a few switchbacks on a vegetation rich part of the trail; pants are advised over shorts. If stashing water for an overnight trip, a good location is Keys View Trailhead near Juniper Flats Parking Area to California Riding and Hiking Trail Connector because it is almost exactly halfway on the trail. For camping, though, plan on either camping before picking up water so that you do not camp near the road or a few miles after at either Ryan Campground or further. \r\n\nYou'll not see many people on the trail except near the trailheads and Backcountry Boards. After passing Ryan Campground, you'll remain in Juniper Flats until you go through a mountain pass which involves about 200 ft of very light and gradual climbing. When going through the pass, you'll hike near a rusted water pipe, which you cross over a few times as well. This pipe is probably what was used to pump water 3.5 miles from the spring at Ryan Ranch to the local mine. \r\n\nThe hike is then extremely flat with a slight downhill which will take you until about the 30-mile mark, at which point you turn left after crossing Pinto Basin Rd and crest over until you begin to see into 29 Palms. The trail then runs parallel to Pinto Basin Rd until you cross over a small one-lane paved road just after the 33-mile mark. Then the trail makes a hard right to go around a small hill, and the trail becomes overgrown with green vegetation, but there are trail markers with arrows showing the way to go. \r\n\nAfter going around the hill, the trail runs parallel to Park Blvd and along the trail, there are manhole covers with a label reading High Voltage, Southern California Edison.

  "description": "The Upper Oat Hill Mine Trail follows over the former Oat Hill Mine Road. This road was an important means of transportation between the local town of Calistoga and the Oat Hill Mine, the third largest quicksilver or mercury mine. The mine operated from the early 1870's to the late 1960's. Today, the 8.3-mile road connects Aetna Springs Road and Calistoga. The trail can prove difficult with rocky terrain, but it is open to hikers, mountain bicyclists, and equestrians. \r\n\nThe trailhead for the Upper Oat Hill Mine Trail is along Aetna Springs Road, with limited parking. The entire trail is well-maintained and well-marked, with posts marking every mile. The trail follows along the ridge, with well shaded areas allowing you to meander through the oak and cypress trees above the Napa Valley. The Upper Oat Hill Mine Trail ends at Holm's Place, an old homestead property of Karl Gustov Holm who built a log cabin in 1893. Parts of the stone wall from the barn remain in the area. At this point, the trail meets with the Palisades Trail and the Lower Oat Hill Mine Trail. The Palisades Trail goes north to Table Rock.",

There are only three parking spots, but there is parking available along 29, very close to the trailhead. Starting out, you'll hike around the local vineyards, with a metal fence along your left side. About 0.25 miles along the trail, you'll see your first vista overlook, allowing you to look out upon Napa Valley. About 0.75 miles along the trail, you'll see another vista overlook, with another sweeping view of Napa Valley. \r\n\nThe entire trail is well-maintained and well-marked, with posts marking every mile. From 0.75 miles to 2.33 miles, the trail climbs up to a ridge and then remains relatively even afterward.

This will spit you out of the shade and straight into very open fields of rolling hills. As you wind your way through these hills, take a few moments to look back and enjoy Bennett Valley's lovely scenery. You'll reach the top of these gentle hills and face steep (but shaded) switchbacks. Once again, there's a gap between the trees so be sure you take a few minutes to really let the beauty of the view sink in.

This short loop trail takes hikers through Fern Canyon, a stunning canyon whose 30-ft walls are lined with ferns. These ferns, which cover the canyon walls, are an ancient species with an ancestry that dates back to nearly 325 million years ago. \r\n\nTo access the Fern Canyon Loop Trail, park at the nearby Fern Canyon parking area off of Davison Road and head north on the Coastal Trail for a short ways before taking the right-hand turn onto the Fern Canyon Loop Trail. The trail starts with a short, easy uphill trek before leveling off in the canyon as you hike along the streambed of Home Creek. There may be some trees along the way that you'll have to climb over or under.\r\n\nThis section of the trail is absolutely stunning, as you hike through an area straight out of prehistoric times. This large canyon is completely covered with ferns -  dark, green sword ferns, velvety five-fingered ferns, and delicate lady ferns. Small sections of the trail are on a boardwalk, and dirt paths meander through this giant canyon.\r\n\nThe trail then climbs out of the canyon to a junction with the James Irvine Trail; stay left to continue on the loop.

  "description": "Visitors to Redwood National Park frequently come to admire the giant coastal redwoods the call this area home, and the Tall Trees Trail is the perfect trail on which to visit some of the park's giants. An excursion to this trail will take nearly half a day, and the park recommends allotting ~4 hours to reach the trailhead and complete your journey on this trail. The last few miles of driving to this location will be on a winding dirt road. This makes it especially difficult for larger vehicles such as RV's to access the trailhead, and travel isn't recommended for vehicles over 21 feet in length. \r\n\nAfter the scenic drive to the trailhead, you'll park your car near a picnic area and trailhead. From there, two trails will depart, this one and the Emerald Ridge Trail. Take the more northern of the two, and keep right at any intersections. From here, you'll enjoy about 1.5 miles of shady, downhill hiking. There are a few steeper portions of the trail, so use caution on your way down. \r\n\nAt the end of the descent, you'll have reached an alluvial flat. The trail here will split both right and left. You can take either route, as this is a looped portion of the trail. This route heads to the left first, following along Redwood Creek. You'll enjoy a series of boardwalks through this section, which keep your feet dry even when water levels are high. Enjoy this opportunity to get especially close to the water and to observe the full-time residents! \r\n\nAs you continue on your way, the trail will eventually duck back into the trees. It is in this section that the already large redwood forest will show off some of the tallest members of the grove. Take your time to admire the scale of the trees in this portion, as some of them are truly massive! Once you've made your way through the grove, you'll find yourself back at the intersection where you initially turned left. \r\n\nMake another left to begin your 1.5 mile hike back to the car. Note that the elevation that you lost on the way to the grove has to be made up, and you'll be climbing for most of the return trip.",

You can start the hike from either end and there are several parking areas along the park road so you can check out different sections without hiking the entire trail. Many people use this trail for jogging and watching the sunset. This recent trip, I went early one morning around 6 a.m. for a peaceful and relaxing hike. This is a trail I could walk or run every day. \r\n\nAs you hike the coastal trail, take careful note of the rock formations just off the coastline. There are quite a few arches created by erosion from the waves beating the rocks. Some of the arches are easy to find while others are a little more difficult. Some have to be seen from a certain angle. Others are small but arches none the less. This is the most concentration of arches I've seen along the coast.\r\n\nWhenever I am in Mendocino or Fort Bragg just north on the coast, I make time to visit Mendocino Headlands to watch the sunset. There are so many great location to watch from here. The rocks and cliffs protruding from the ocean make a great foreground as the sun sets on the horizon.

This is located about 20 miles west of Leggett, CA. Once you get to the exit, it takes about 45 minutes to drive the 6 miles to Usal Campground. The dirt road is a single lane that can be extremely steep in places. 4WD may be necessary during some parts of the year so call the local ranger station to check road status before heading out. Be sure that your reverse driving skills are sharp because you may have to drive backwards along this road for a small stretch due to oncoming traffic.\r\n\nOnce at the campsite, pay the $5/night parking fee and start heading along Usal Rd to the north. You'll see a very distinct single-path trail that heads into the Redwoods and up a hillside. There used to be typical trail sign here, but it has since been replaced.\r\n\nRight from the get go, this trail starts off with a good dose of switchbacks and incline. It stays this way for the first mile or so, and then you reach a clearing where you can see Usal Beach down below. From here, its more incline as you climb the mountains that overlook the southern end of The Lost Coast. \r\n\nLittle Jackass Creek is about 7 miles away from Usal. In those 7 miles, you'll cross 3 different creeks (one of which has a small primitive campsite; Anderson Camp). Each one of these has running water in case you need to replenish your water. Every time you cross these creeks, you can expect anywhere from 800-1200 feet in elevation change. There will be some flat portion in between those changes for you to catch your breath. \r\n\nThere are many tall ferns, trees, and other plants that overhang the trail the whole time.

The two terms are used interchangeably by locals, but there is only one El Cap, and it is in Yosemite.   \r\n\nGetting there: The trailhead is located on the right side of Wildcat Canyon Road when traveling from Lakeside to Barona Indian Reservation. Expect the main parking lot and the Oakoasis county preserve parking lot located across the street to be full on the weekend. There is limited parking on the roadside, but be careful as this road is busy and dangerous. Get there right at 8 a.m. when the gate opens to avoid the heat and crowds. \r\n\nThe Trail: With the exception of the .5 miles above the trailhead and the .25 miles below the summit block, this trail is more of a wilderness freeway/doubletrack truck trail. The concept of switchbacks clearly eluded the trail builders as it takes a very direct path up the mountain. It is well traveled so one does not get the back-country adventure feel, however this is ideal for a quad-burning hike. It is very well-signed; route finding will not be an issue.\r\n\nDirections: From the parking lot, head up a dirt road with a 100yd section of reddish concrete road. Private property lines this road, but don't be fooled this is not someone's driveway. The official trailhead is .5 miles up the road and has bathrooms and picnic tables, but there is no parking allowed here. Pass the bathrooms, follow signs for El Cajon Mountain and take a left at the fork. The trail turns to singletrack switchbacks and continues to climb for another half mile. \r\n\nAt the top of the ridge, the trail widens to dirt singletrack and continues at a moderate downhill grade for the next 1.2 miles. Multiple trails crisscross the main trail in this section but stay on the most obvious path and follow signs for El Cajon Mountain Summit. The next 1.7-mile section is wide doubletrack but is extremely steep and loose gravel makes footing tenuous. This is the most strenuous section of the climb. The trail then levels out on a ridge with great views. This is a common turnaround point and is a perfect stopping point for a moderate 7 mile out-and-back. \r\n\nAfter this point, the trail narrows and follows a very rocky, shaded wash downhill for .7 miles. The next mile is a steep climb on less well-maintained doubletrack. The final quarter mile push to the summit is on a steep, rocky, slightly overgrown singletrack trail with light scrambling required. The trail is faint, but very well marked.",

  "name": "Mt. Baldy Trail #7W12",
  "description": "The trail starts at the end of Bear Canyon Drive. From the visitor center, hike southwest through the site past a gate to the road and then proceed a half mile up the road. The trail starts by crossing the stream then climbs gently through Bear Canyon in a forest of oak, bigcone spruce, alders, bay, and incense cedar with occasional areas of chaparral that have good wildflowers in spring. After 1 mile, the trail reaches Bear Flat where there are a few camping sites near a seasonal spring.\r\n\nA pleasant meadow offers a nice resting point after which the trail steeply switchbacks up through shadeless chaparral of ceanothus and oak finally reaching some Jeffrey Pines near the top of the ridge. About 2 miles up, it passes into the Sheep Mountain Wilderness then continues steeply north on the ridge offering outstanding views of Coldwater Canyon to the west.  Sugar pines and white fir offer refreshing shade. A bare ridge with steep slopes on both sides is crossed, and the trail enters into a lodgepole pine forest with mounds of chinquapin groundcover. The trail continues along the edge of a large natural depression as it turns northeast on the slope of West Baldy. Finally, the trail reaches the west ridge of Mt. Baldy and climbs up to the 10,064 ft. bare summit. The highest point in the San Gabriel Mountains has outstanding views in all directions.\r\n\nBe sure to look back at the direction you came. People have died taking a wrong turn on the descent. Dangerous weather can occur at any time of the year. The temperature difference between the bottom and top can vary as much as 40 degrees. Snow can linger well into late spring and summer. This is a strenuous hike at high elevation and proper hydration is critical for your health.",

Soon after beginning your hike you'll cross the creek and climb slightly up the hillside. 1/2 of a mile into the trail you'll see another trail diverging to the right. This trail makes for a great byway that later reunites with the main Rattlesnake Canyon Trail a mile later. However, continuing along the main trail you cross over the creek a couple of times before reaching a huge, flat rock, known as \"Lunch Rock\", that sits in the creek.\r\n\nAfter crossing the creek once again you'll follow the trail to Tin Can Meadow, which was named after a homestead cabin that once existed there before it unfortunately burned down in 1925. A trail junction sits at the end of this meadow, at which point you'll want to bear right to follow the Rattlesnake Canyon Trail for another 3/4 of a mile until it hits Gibraltar Rd. The Rattlesnake Canyon Trail ends at this intersection with the road, but there are stunning views of the South Coast from this point.\r\n\nThanks to John McKinney, The Trailmaster, for sharing this trail description.

Once you are at the trailhead where the sign is, the trail splits. You can take the right path which is the easier path with the slowest elevation gain, or you can take the left path which has more incline, but gets you to the top faster. Once at the top, the trails meet and you can take the opposite one down of the one you came up on and get the full effect of the mountain. \r\n\nFeel free to bring your dog as long as it is leashed.

After another short climb the trail arrives at the top of Snow Summit before switchbacking as the trail rolls up and down alongside the side of the mountain. After being on trail for 10.2 miles you'll reach a big descent that will end with a slight uphill that exists just before the end of the trail.

  "description": "Trabuco Canyon Trail is travelled in both directions, and is often used to complete loops. The trail is 100% singletrack.\r\n\nAs mapped, the trail starts to the right around a green guard barrier and heads down immediately.  Initially the trail will be in deep shade but will alternate between shade and sun. The trail definitely has a \"beginning, middle, & end.\" The beginning is nice - a little loose and occasionally rutted, but mostly fun & easy going with some chances to appreciate the view. At a 90-degree left turn, keep an eye out for the \"Christmas Tree\" that gets an ornament or 2 around the holidays.  \r\n\nYou'll know you're in the 'middle' section when the shale begins and the shade goes away. This section requires a little caution, since the trail traverses sharp gravel and there are a few steeper (~15% grade) spots. \r\n\nShortly after the shale ends, you'll come to Trabuco Creek, a mostly dry wide rocky creek crossing. Once on the other side, the grade decreases and the trail is more pleasant (still some rocks and roots through). Another green guard gate marks the end of the trail.",

  "description": "This trail travels between a trailhead low on Mount Diablo State Park's South Gate Road (no parking) and the summit of Mount Diablo via the south face of the mountain. Parts of the trail are singletrack and parts are dirt road. \r\n\nLeaving the South Gate Road Trailhead, this trail climbs up canyon into the Rock City area, interesting for its geology and for its bouldering opportunities, and meets Wall Point Road coming in from the west. Despite the various trail names you'll encounter here (maps and trail signs may not agree with each other), there are several possible \"Summit Trail\" routes from here going uphill, and all will take you eventually to the shoulder of South Gate Road, so you can be creative. \r\n\nOnce you have passed the Ridge View Trail and crossed South Gate Road, and are climbing with the road to your left, you'll see the summit ahead of you, and views will begin to open up in the other directions. This trail's route is now more direct, and sometimes quite steep. You'll be encountering areas that burned during the Morgan Fire of September 2013, and in these areas vegetation will be quite different (in the spring, wildflower blooms can be excellent). Along the way this trail crosses Summit Road twice. Then, approaching the summit area, this trail contours just below Summit Road, providing fine views to the south. \r\n\nAt Devils Elbow, this trail grazes the outside edge of a hairpin turn on Summit Road (North Peak Trail departs from here going east) and switches back just above it. Soon this trail reaches the summit area, with a parking area to the left. To the right, you'll see Mary Bowerman Trail (aka Fire Interpretive Trail, referring to the Morgan Fire) veer right, but instead this trail crosses the one-way vehicle road leading toward the summit and continues into a thin \"island\" of rocky outcrops inside the one-way vehicle road loop. \r\n\nContinue on this trail to the actual summit, where you'll find a restroom building as well as the summit building with an observation deck on the roof.
